Deliverable spec:

You will specify the project objective, select the appropriate board, and specific hardware and software needed. Your proposal must include a one paragraph justification of the choices. A back-of-napkin drawing can be included. Identify from where the board will be ordered (Please ensure that you will receive it within a week or so), and how you will obtain the needed software and documentation, and the expected cost.
